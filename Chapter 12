Chapter 12

integration of GIS and ABM
geospatial agent based model


12.2.1

GIS :

not enough ability to deal with dynamic simulation
but have good preprocessing tool or good visualization tool

But API was emerged. and they start using standard programing langage like python

space-time information
(1)location based (2)time-based, and (3)entity-based, but seriase of snapshots of each time steps.  the datasize is huge and inefficient.


12.2.2
coupling together / integration embedding

coupling
(1)loose coupling: data exchanged between systems in thr form of files

(2)moderate coupling: 

(3)tight coupling: direct inter-system communication during the programme execution.

integration

*what is the difference between tight coupling and integration?*

12.3

distinction between explanatory vs. predictive purpose if model.

designed: their behavior represents conditons for testing specific hyposesis
analysed: intend to mimic real-world entities besed on data.

12.3.2 Guideline for choseing a simulation/modeling system

12.3.3 They provide key criteria to selection of simulation system available for the development of agent=based models.

12.4 summary
the choice of the system they use dependant upon a modellerâ€™s knowledge and experience of ABM in general, and each simulation/modelling system in particular

Chapter 25

They try to simulate the dynamics in housing market using agent based modeling. Focusing on the theme of urban regeneration.

residential mobility and housing choice

macroeconomic policy, faimily life style and income change
neighborhood quality

25.3
agent = each household

policy = affects the available house stock in the market

they mentions some segragation model which are based on shelling.

25.4
two type of household -- want to move, just stay

they use actual data to determine the factor which affects the decision they move or not

move seven rules.
